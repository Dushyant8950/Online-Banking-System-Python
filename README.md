# Online-Banking-System-Python
The provided code is a Python-based Online Bank Management System built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and pickle for data storage. It allows users to manage simple banking operations like creating a new bank account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking account balance, updating account information, deleting accounts, and viewing all existing accounts in a table. Each bank account is represented by an Account class that holds details like account number, holder's name, account type (Savings or Current), and balance. All accounts are stored in a local file (accounts.data) using serialization via the pickle module to ensure data persists even after closing the application. The GUI provides input fields, radio buttons for account type selection, and buttons for various operations, while a treeview table neatly displays all account records. Error handling is implemented through message boxes to ensure the user is notified of successes or failures during operations like deposits, withdrawals, and updates. This project showcases fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and GUI development in Python.
